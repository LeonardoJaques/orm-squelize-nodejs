Sequelize is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Node.js that allows you to connect to a MySql database and map the data in the database to objects in your application. It provides a set of functions for performing various operations on the database, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.


You can find more information about using Sequelize in the official documentation at https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/migrations/.
